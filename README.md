Hi there — I’m CK 👋

An MBA and 5 years of work experience guided me straight down the analytics rabbit hole — from the west coast of India to the west-most coast of the world.

Along the way, I’ve built AI-first MVPs, engineered machine learning models, shipped full stack products, delivered global product launches, and led omnichannel growth campaigns. From product roadmaps to campaign execution, and from learning code to building AI products. I’ve loved doing everything, everywhere — just not all at once. 

I'm currently spending my days ideating growth strategies and nights shipping open source AI products. With a prior MBA and a recent Masters, I possess a rare combination of a generalist's breadth with a specialist's depth. 

I thrive at the intersection of **AI, product, and analytics** so after successfully navigating the tides of the corporate landscape across agency, media, and tech enterprises, I'm now keen to explore mutual growth opportunities with startups in the Bay Area for the summer. 

Let’s connect and co-create what’s next.

Work Availability: Full-time roles starting June 23, 2025

Willing to relocate for the right role, but I'm committed to doing my life's best in my favorite city, San Francisco!
</p>
