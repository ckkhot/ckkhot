Hey there, I’m CK 👋

An MBA and 5 years of work spanning strategy, marketing, and growth led me straight down the analytics rabbit hole, from the west coast of India to the west-most coast of the world.

With a prior MBA and a recent Masters, I possess a generalist's breadth with a specialist's depth. I'm a strategist turned operator and a marketer turned developer. I specialize in AI products, growth engineering, and gtm operations. 

I thrive at the intersection of **Product, growth and analytics** so after successfully navigating the tides of the corporate landscape across agency, media, and tech enterprises, I'm now keen to explore mutual growth opportunities with startups in the Bay Area. 

Let’s connect and co-create what’s next.
