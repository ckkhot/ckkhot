Hi there — I’m CK 👋

With 5+ years in strategy and operations, I found my way into the analytics rabbit hole — from the west coast of India to the west-most coast of the world.

Along the way, I’ve delivered global product launches, built AI-first MVPs, led marketing campaigns, and engineered machine learning models. From campaign execution to product roadmaps, I’ve loved doing everything, everywhere — just not all at once.

I thrive at the intersection of **product, strategy, analytics, and AI**, and I’m currently seeking my next adventure in the heart of Silicon Valley.

Let’s connect and co-create what’s next.
